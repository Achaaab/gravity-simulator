## Description
This project aims to simulate gravity forces between bodies in order to render our solar system.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing 
purposes.

### Prerequisites
* Java 18
* Maven 3.8.6
* Git 2.25.1

### Installing and running
* Clone the repository from GitHub:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Achaaab/gravity-simulator.git
```
* Build and run the project with Maven:
```shell
cd gravity-simulator
mvn javafx:run
```

### Usage
* [SCROLL UP] : about 22% zoom in (it may depend on your mouse configuration)
* [SCROLL DOWN] : about 22% zoom out (it may depend on your mouse configuration)
* [TAB]: next anchor body (the anchor body is fixed at the center of the window)
* [SHIFT] + [TAB] : previous anchor body
* [+] : increase time scale by a factor 3/2
* [-] : decrease time scale by a factor 3/2

## Improvements
* Currently, the simulation is updated 60 times per second. In this interval, bodies move in a straight line (discrete 
  simulation). This approximation can make bodies escape their orbit, if the time scale is too big. A possible 
  workaround is to split the scaled time interval into small time intervals which must not be bigger than a fixed value, 
  for example, 1 day. With this workaround, the CPU load will increases with the time scale to compute every
  intermediate position between frames.

* Bodies start at their apoapsis point, which is fixed on the right. This is probably not realistic and could be improved.

* A menu would be nice to explain usage.

* A tri-dimensional version would be great.
